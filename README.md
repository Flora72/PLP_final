## Tech Stack

- **Type**: Web Application  
Note: Healing Atlas is optimized for desktop browsers. Mobile access is possible, but the experience may feel visually compressed or less spacious. For the most emotionally clear and structured experience, we recommend using a laptop or desktop device._
- **Backend**: Django (Python)  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- **Database**: SQLite (initially), scaled to PostgreSQL  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Hugging Face API (used to generate emotional insights from journal entries and mood logs)  
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub  
- **Deployment**: Render (automated builds from GitHub)  
- **Methodology**: Vibe Coding — emotionally paced prompting and healing-centered development

---

## Build Process (Step-by-Step)

1. **Emotional Mapping & Ideation**  
   - Defined survivor needs and emotional milestones  
   - Created a pacing map for onboarding flow  

2. **Django Setup**  
   - Initialized Django project and apps  
   - Configured models for users, resources, and payment integration  

3. **Database Design**  
   - Started with SQLite for simplicity  
   - Structured tables for trauma-informed data handling  
   - Migrated to PostgreSQL to support secure, scalable deployment on Render

4. **Frontend Development**  
   - Built responsive layouts with HTML, CSS  
   - Added interactive elements with JavaScript  
   - Styled with emotional cues (color, spacing, copy)  

5. **Views & Templates**  
   - Created Django views for onboarding, dashboard, and resource pages  
   - Used Django templating for dynamic rendering  
   - Integrated Hugging Face API to analyze journal and mood data, generating sentiment charts that visualize emotional patterns over time  

6. **Deployment**  
   - Versioned with GitHub  
   - Deployed via Render

## Prompting Journey (Vibe Coding)

This project was built using emotionally paced prompting. Here’s how the flow unfolded:

- **Prompt 1**: “Design a dashboard that feels like a warm hug but still gets things done.”  
- **Prompt 2**: “How do we guide someone gently through a story they’re scared to tell?”  
- **Prompt 3**: “Build a layout that breathes—space, softness, and clarity.”  
- **Prompt 4**: “What does safety look like in a button? In a font?”

Each prompt led to design and dev decisions that centered emotional safety. The vibe coding method allowed intuition and empathy to guide the technical build.
